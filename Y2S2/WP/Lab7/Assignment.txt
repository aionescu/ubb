Together with the URL, a description/comment and a category must be added to the database.
The user can add, remove and modify URLs and the associated descriptions.
Also the user can browse using AJAX the list of URLs grouped by their categories.

URL browsing should be paged - URLs are displayed on pages with maximum 4 URLs on a page (you should be able to go to the previous and the next page).
